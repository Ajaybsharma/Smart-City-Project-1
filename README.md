# Smart City Project

A comprehensive Python-based Smart City system focusing on sustainability analysis and optimization. This project implements a multi-layered architecture for collecting, processing, and analyzing urban data to optimize resource usage and enhance sustainability.

## Architecture Overview

This project implements the architecture shown in the provided diagram, with these key layers:

1. **Data Collection Layer**:
   - Collects data from OpenStreetMap, real estate datasets, and IoT sensors
   - Validates and aggregates data from multiple sources

2. **Data Processing Layer**: 
   - Preprocesses raw data for analysis
   - Engineers meaningful features
   - Normalizes data for consistent analysis

3. **AI Model Layer**:
   - Trains machine learning models on processed data
   - Deploys models for real-time predictions
   - Evaluates model performance and accuracy

4. **Sustainability Metrics Layer**:
   - Analyzes water availability and usage
   - Evaluates waste management and recycling
   - Considers environmental factors for sustainability

5. **Optimization Layer**:
   - Applies machine learning to optimize sustainability
   - Measures optimization effectiveness with performance metrics

## Key Features

- Comprehensive data collection from geographical, real estate, and IoT sensors
- Advanced data processing pipeline with feature engineering
- AI models for prediction and analysis of urban sustainability metrics
- Detailed sustainability analysis for water, waste, and environmental factors
- Optimization tools to identify optimal resource usage strategies

## System Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-city-project.git
cd smart-city-project

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main application:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

This will execute the full Smart City pipeline from data collection to optimization, and save the results to the `results` directory.
