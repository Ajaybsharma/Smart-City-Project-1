# Smart City Project

A comprehensive Python-based Smart City system focusing on sustainability analysis and optimization. This project implements a multi-layered architecture for collecting, processing, and analyzing urban data to optimize resource usage and enhance sustainability.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive data collection from geographical, real estate, and IoT sensors
- Advanced data processing pipeline with feature engineering
- AI models for prediction and analysis of urban sustainability metrics
- Detailed sustainability analysis for water, waste, and environmental factors
- Optimization tools to identify optimal resource usage strategies


# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt



## Usage

Run the main application:
python src/main.py
```

This will execute the full Smart City pipeline from data collection to optimization, and save the results to the `results` directory.





## Components
